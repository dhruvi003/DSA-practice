- collection of characters
- String is class of java

concept 0 :

String name = "Nisarg"
here, the string 'nisarg' is an object


concept 1:

String a = "nisarg"
String b = "nisarg"

here, both the variables a and b will be pointing to the same heap memory.

**** String pool ****
in java, we have a saperate memory allocation for String data type variables
called as String Pool or Heap Memory (Runtime Data Area)

whenever you create a new String variable with the same value,
it first checks in the String

now if we change in any one variable, the second variable value will not change
because of immutability.

strings are immutable in java

-- in java, for the optimization, we have string pool and 
for security, we have immutability

we don't chage object, we create another object and old object becomes garbage collection



concept 3:
- some is done in strring.java 

when you only needs to check value, use '.equals()' method



concept 4: Pretty printing
- this is similar to C language i/object

float a = 3.2434234;

System.out.printf("%.2f",a) 

this will print 3.24  // as we have specified 2 digit for decimal

concept 5: '+' operator
- this operator joins two string
- we can join to complex objects by providing an empty string

concept 6: String builder
- it is a separate data type
- we cannot change string as they are immutable, so every time we do some change 
in string, it just creates a new string
but in case of stringbuilder, only one reference is made
so memory wastage does not occur
