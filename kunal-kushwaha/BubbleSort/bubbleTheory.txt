It is comparison sort method
- What we do?
    1) Compare two adjacent elements
    2) If not in order -> Swap elements

- After first iteration, the largest element comes largest

AKA, sinking sort or exchange sort

Best case : Sorted --> O(n)
-> when j never swaps for any perticular value of 'i', it means that array is Sorted

Worst case : Reverse --> O(n^2)

Space : O(1)

Inplace sorting algo as we don't havae to create a new array

Stable Sorting algorithm
-> Order should be the same when the value is the same
