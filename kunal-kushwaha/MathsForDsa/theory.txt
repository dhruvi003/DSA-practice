Concept 1: Number System
- many types like base 2, base 10, base 16 etc
- computer understands base 2 number System
- we've been studying base 10 number System

*** Operators ***
1) Bitwise AND
- &
- takes two numbers and performs bitwise AND operation on them. 
It returns the result of each bit

when you '&' with 1 number, the digits will remain the same

2) OR 
- Anyone is true, all are true

3) XOR - if and only if
- ^
- a ^ 1 = complement of a 
- a ^ 0 = a
- a ^ a = 0

Concept 4: Negative number in binary
- the most significant bit in bits of any number shows whether a number is +/-
- +/- 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1
- __  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 


steps: -- 2's complement method
1) complement of a given number
2) add 1 to it.

Range of numbers
- total numbers we can have in 1 byte are 2^7 = 128 possibilities.
total unique numbers : 2^8

To find range for n bits

-2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1
