what is backtracking? how do we know we wish to do backtracking?

Simple question: 
given 3X3 matrix, standing at (0,0) and reach (2,2). how many ways we can reach?
- we can only go right and down. so print how many ways we can go?

Possible ways : R R D D , D D R R, R D D R, R D R D
 How can we take recursion out of this?
First let's print no of ways for reaching point (2,2)?
when we've reached the last column, there's only one path downwords and if we've reached last row, there's only one path towards right'
so we reach last row/col, there's only one way.
recursion will be like, path till some point + Recursion(Remaining possible paths)
