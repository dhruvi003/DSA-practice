divide array in two part, sort first half and after that sort second half
after sorted, merge the arrays

Steps:
1) divide array into two parts
Get both parts sorted via recursion
2) merge the sorted parts

when one array gets empty while merging, 
put the remaining array into the sorted array

-we are returning an array from here so the return type will be an array

-base condition is when length of array is 1 

At each level, n elements are getting merged togather

Best time complexity : O(N logN)
